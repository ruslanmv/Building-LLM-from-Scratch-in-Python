### **1. Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism (Mathematics)**

**Mathematical Explanation:**

The multi-head self-attention mechanism computes how each word (or token) in the input should attend to other words in the sequence. Each word is associated with three vectors: query \( Q \), key \( K \), and value \( V \).

1. **Key, Query, and Value Projections:**
   Each input word is projected into these vectors using learned weights:
   \[
   Q = XW_Q, \quad K = XW_K, \quad V = XW_V
   \]
   where \( W_Q, W_K, W_V \) are the learned weight matrices, and \( X \) represents the input tokens.

2. **Attention Mechanism:**
   The attention score between each pair of words is calculated using the dot product between the query and key vectors:
   \[
   \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{D_h}} \right) V
   \]
   Here, \( D_h \) is the dimensionality of the query/key vectors, and the softmax function is used to compute attention weights.

3. **Multi-Head Attention:**
   Several attention heads are used in parallel:
   \[
   \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \text{head}_2, \dots, \text{head}_h)W_O
   \]
   Each head performs independent attention computations, and their outputs are concatenated and projected using weight matrix \( W_O \).

**Connection to Example (During Generation):**

In the **text generation example**:

```python
prompt = "The quick brown"
```

- When the input "The quick brown" is tokenized and passed through the model, the multi-head self-attention computes attention weights between "The", "quick", and "brown", determining how much influence each word has on predicting the next token.
- The attention scores control how much the model "attends" to different tokens when predicting the next one.

---

### **2. Positional Encoding (Mathematics)**

The Transformer lacks inherent information about the order of words. Therefore, positional encoding is used to provide the model with this sequence information.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

1. **Positional Encoding Formula:**
   For a token at position \( pos \), and for dimension \( 2i \) or \( 2i+1 \), the positional encoding is given by:
   \[
   PE(pos, 2i) = \sin \left( \frac{pos}{10000^{2i/D}} \right), \quad PE(pos, 2i+1) = \cos \left( \frac{pos}{10000^{2i/D}} \right)
   \]
   where \( D \) is the dimension of the embedding.

2. **Adding Positional Encodings:**
   The positional encoding is added to the word embedding to create a final representation that includes both the word meaning and its position in the sequence.

**Connection to Example (During Generation):**

In the **text generation** prompt:

```python
prompt = "The quick brown"
```

- The positional encoding adds sequence information, ensuring the model understands that "The" is the first token, "quick" is second, and "brown" is third.
- The embedding of "quick" is modified to reflect its position in the sentence (the second position).

### **3. Transformer Block (Mathematics)**

The core computational unit in the GPT model is the Transformer block. It consists of a multi-head attention mechanism, followed by a feed-forward neural network (FFNN).

**Mathematical Architecture:**

1. **Attention Layer:**
   First, the self-attention mechanism is applied:
   \[
   \text{AttentionOutput} = \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V)
   \]
   This calculates the attention-weighted representations of the tokens.

2. **Residual Connection and Layer Normalization:**
   The attention output is added back to the original input (residual connection) and normalized:
   \[
   x_1 = \text{LayerNorm}(x + \text{AttentionOutput})
   \]

3. **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN):**
   The output of the attention layer is passed through a feed-forward network:
   \[
   \text{FFNN}(x) = W_2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_1 \cdot x + b_1) + b_2
   \]
   where \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) are weight matrices, and \( b_1 \), \( b_2 \) are bias vectors.

4. **Second Residual Connection:**
   Another residual connection is applied, followed by layer normalization:
   \[
   x_2 = \text{LayerNorm}(x_1 + \text{FFNN}(x_1))
   \]

**Connection to Example (During Training):**

In the training dataset:

```python
text = """
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 
This is an example of a small dataset for training a GPT model.
We are building a transformer-based architecture.
"""
```

- During training, the Transformer block processes this text to learn patterns, such as the relationship between "quick" and "brown" or "fox" and "jumps".
- The multi-head attention mechanism attends to different parts of the input sentence, while the FFNN helps refine the token representations.

### **4. GPT Model (Mathematics)**

The overall GPT model consists of multiple stacked Transformer blocks.

**Mathematical Architecture:**

1. **Input Embeddings:**
   The input sequence is tokenized, and each token is mapped to a dense vector using an embedding matrix \( E \):
   \[
   \text{Embedding}(x) = E(x)
   \]

2. **Positional Encoding:**
   Positional encodings are added to the embeddings to provide the model with sequence information:
   \[
   \text{Embedding}(x) + \text{PositionalEncoding}(x)
   \]

3. **Stacked Transformer Blocks:**
   The embedded input is passed through a stack of Transformer blocks:
   \[
   x_{\text{out}} = \text{TransformerBlock}_n(\dots \text{TransformerBlock}_1(x) \dots)
   \]

4. **Output Layer:**
   The final output from the last Transformer block is projected back into the vocabulary space using a linear layer:
   \[
   \text{Logits} = W_{\text{out}} \cdot x_{\text{out}} + b
   \]

**Connection to Example (During Training):**

In the dataset:

```python
text = """
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 
This is an example of a small dataset for training a GPT model.
We are building a transformer-based architecture.
"""
```

- The input tokens are first passed through the embedding layer, and the positional encodings are added.
- The input sequence, now embedded and positionally encoded, is passed through multiple Transformer blocks to learn contextual relationships between tokens.
- The output of the final Transformer block is passed through a linear layer to predict the next token in the sequence.

---

### **5. Training (Mathematics)**

The model is trained using cross-entropy loss. The goal is to predict the next token given the previous tokens.

**Training Objective:**

1. **Cross-Entropy Loss:**
   The model is trained to minimize the following loss function:
   \[
   \mathcal{L} = - \sum_{i=1}^{T} \log P(y_i | x_{1:i-1})
   \]
   where \( y_i \) is the true token, and \( P(y_i | x_{1:i-1}) \) is the predicted probability of token \( y_i \) given the preceding tokens.

2. **Backpropagation:**
   The gradients of the loss function are computed with respect to the model's parameters, and the parameters are updated using an optimizer (Adam in this case) to reduce the loss.

**Connection to Example (During Training):**

When training on this small dataset:

```python
text = """
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 
This is an example of a small dataset for training a GPT model.
We are building a transformer-based architecture.
"""
```

- The input sequence "The quick brown fox" is used to predict the next token "jumps".
- The cross-entropy loss is computed based on the predicted token and the true token ("jumps").
- The model updates its parameters through backpropagation to minimize the difference between predicted and actual tokens.

---

### **6. Generating Text (Mathematics)**

Once the model is trained, it can generate text autoregressively. Given a prompt, the model predicts the next token, appends it to the input, and repeats the process.

**Mathematical Process:**

1. **Token Prediction:**
   For a given input sequence \( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_T \), the model predicts the next token by computing:
   \[
   P(y_{T+1} | x_1, x_2, \dots, x_T)
   \

]
   The next token \( y_{T+1} \) is selected as the token with the highest probability:
   \[
   y_{T+1} = \arg \max P(y_{T+1} | x_1, x_2, \dots, x_T)
   \]

2. **Sequence Extension:**
   The predicted token \( y_{T+1} \) is appended to the sequence, and the process is repeated to generate the next token.

**Connection to Example (During Generation):**

In the **generation example**:

```python
prompt = "The quick brown"
generated_text = generate_text(model, prompt, vocab, max_len=50)
```

- The model takes the prompt "The quick brown" and computes the probability distribution for the next token.
- The most probable token is selected (e.g., "fox") and added to the sequence.
- This process is repeated until the model generates a sequence of length 50.

### Conclusion

In summary, the architecture of the GPT model uses multi-head self-attention to compute dependencies between tokens in a sequence, positional encodings to incorporate sequence order, and stacked Transformer blocks to refine token representations. The training process uses cross-entropy loss to learn to predict the next token, and the trained model can then be used to generate new text based on a prompt. The mathematical concepts behind this process (attention, embeddings, loss functions) correspond directly to how the model processes the input text and generates outputs during training and inference.
