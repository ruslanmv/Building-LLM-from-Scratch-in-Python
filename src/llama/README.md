
# Building LLaMA from Scratch
This repository contains the code and instructions to build and train a lightweight transformer model inspired by Meta's LLaMA.

## Prerequisites

* **WSL Ubuntu:** Ensure you have Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu installed and updated.

## Environment Setup

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv 
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Optional: Install IPython Kernel and Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   pip install ipykernel notebook
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=.venv
   ```
   This allows you to run the code within Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

* **requirements.txt:** Contains a list of Python libraries needed to run this project.
* **model.py:** (You'll need to create this)  Contains the PyTorch implementation of the LLaMA-like transformer model.
* **train.py:** (You'll need to create this) Contains the training and fine-tuning scripts.

## Training the Model

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   * Use the code provided in the blog to load and tokenize your dataset.
   * Place the dataset in an appropriate location within your project.

2. **Run the training script:**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   * Make sure `train.py` imports the model from `model.py` and includes the training loop from the blog post.

## Running in a Jupyter Notebook

1. **Start the notebook server:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open a new notebook:**
   * Select the kernel associated with your virtual environment (`.venv`).
   * Paste the code from the blog post into the notebook cells.
   * Execute the cells to build, train, and fine-tune the model.

## Key Points

* The code in this repository is a simplified implementation of LLaMA. Meta's official implementation might have additional optimizations and features.
* Experiment with different datasets and hyperparameters to fine-tune the model for specific tasks.
* If you run into issues, double-check your virtual environment and ensure all required libraries are installed correctly.

**Explanation of Steps**

1. **Virtual Environment:**
   * Creates an isolated environment to manage project-specific dependencies.
   * Prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

2. **Requirements File:**
   * `requirements.txt` lists all the Python libraries needed (e.g., `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`).
   * `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs these libraries into the virtual environment.

3. **IPython Kernel (Optional):**
   * Allows you to run the code interactively within Jupyter Notebooks.
   * Provides a convenient way to experiment and visualize the results.

**Remember:**

* You'll need to create `model.py` and `train.py` and populate them with the code from the blog post.
* Adapt the dataset loading and training process to fit your specific data and requirements.
